# ANU Linked Earth Data example

The [main document](ANU-LED-example.ttl) is an example of an RDF description of a coverage, using the [RDF Data Cube](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) model. It is referenced by the W3C note [Publishing and Using Earth Observation Data with the RDF Data Cube and the Discrete Global Grid System](http://w3c.github.io/sdw/eo-qb/).

The [second document](example.ttl) is an example of RDF actually generated by our implementation.
